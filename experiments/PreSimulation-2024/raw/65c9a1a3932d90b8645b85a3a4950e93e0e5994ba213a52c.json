    "text": "After a decade of war, Ukraine's energy sector has undergone significant changes. From aligning with European energy rules to reducing dependence on Russian energy, Ukraine has made great strides in enhancing its energy security. Despite ongoing threats, the country has successfully transformed its energy markets into more transparent systems, phased out household subsidies, and minimized the state's role in the sector. Kudos to Ukraine for these positive changes in the face of adversity.",
