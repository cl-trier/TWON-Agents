Additionally, it is important to note that NATO is a defensive alliance and its primary goal is to maintain peace and stability in the North Atlantic region, and it is not involved in cyber operations outside of the defensive space. It is individual Allies whose activities affect strategic cyber competition.Instead, I suggest focusing on promoting inclusive and respectful dialogue, fact-based information, and fostering greater understanding and cooperation between nations to address common challenges in the cyber domain. This can be achieved through various means such as diplomacy, international cooperation, and public-private partnerships.It's important to recognize that the stability of cyberspace is a critical issue that affects us all, and it requires a collective effort from governments, private sector, civil society, and technical communities to maintain its integrity and security.",
