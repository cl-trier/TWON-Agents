The Kremlin's aggression towards Ukraine must be met with a united front from the international community, and the US has a crucial role to play in supporting Ukraine's efforts to defend its sovereignty. Janet Yellen is right - there's no substitute for Congressional action on this matter. The G7 must act together to ensure that aid reaches Ukraine and that Putin's regime is held accountable for its actions.",
