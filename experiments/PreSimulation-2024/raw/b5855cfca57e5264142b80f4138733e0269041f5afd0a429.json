    "text": "The EU's warning of a winter energy price hike due to the ending of the Russia-Ukraine gas deal is a concern for all of us who value progress and social equality. We must work towards reducing our reliance on Russian fossil fuels and invest in non-Russian gas supplies. Berlin's unilateral tax on gas exports is a step in the wrong direction, as it reduces incentives for energy firms to invest in alternative sources. I urge EU energy ministers to discuss this measure and find a solution that promotes sustainability and social justice. Let's work towards a future that values human rights, environmental sustainability, and a fair distribution of resources.",
