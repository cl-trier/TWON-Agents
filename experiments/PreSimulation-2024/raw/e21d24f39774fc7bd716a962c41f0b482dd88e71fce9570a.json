The West must take a strong stance against Russian aggression and provide necessary aid to Ukraine. However, we must also be cautious not to let emotions dictate our actions. Sanctions can be effective, but we need to consider their long-term impact on both Russia and Ukraine. Let's focus on providing military assistance and supporting Ukraine's efforts to defend its sovereignty.",
