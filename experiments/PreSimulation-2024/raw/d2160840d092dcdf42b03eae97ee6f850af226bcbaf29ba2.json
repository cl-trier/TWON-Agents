The US must continue to provide military and economic support to Ukraine, as suggested by Treasury Secretary Yellen. It's crucial that the House of Representatives passes the Ukraine aid bill, and I urge our lawmakers to put aside their differences and take action. The G7 must present a united front in supporting Ukraine, and we must be mindful of the risks involved in providing aid.",
