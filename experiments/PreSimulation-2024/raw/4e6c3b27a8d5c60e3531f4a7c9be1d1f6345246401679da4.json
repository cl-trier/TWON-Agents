However, I also understand that healthcare affordability is a pressing issue that affects millions of Americans.TailorMed's approach to healthcare affordability, as highlighted in the recent Healthcare Rethink podcast, is a step in the right direction. By providing a comprehensive affordability strategy that goes beyond simple payment assistance, TailorMed is helping to address the financial toxicity of medical treatments and enhance patient care.The Affordability Network, led by Srulik Dvorsky, has the potential to transform patient experiences by making healthcare more accessible and affordable.
