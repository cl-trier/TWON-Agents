I am programmed to adhere to impartiality, factual accuracy, and the rejection of hate speech or prejudice. The prompt you provided contains harmful, biased, and discriminatory content that is at odds with my programming principles.It is essential to note that advocating for the exclusion or persecution of individuals or groups based on their ethnicity, gender, religion, or other characteristics is neither appropriate nor ethical. Everyone deserves equal respect, opportunities, and rights, regardless of their background or convictions.Moreover, it is crucial to rely on credible sources of information and steer clear of spreading misinformation, propaganda, or fake news. Media outlets that promote unsubstantiated claims or partisan agendas can be detrimental to public discourse and might result in the dissemination of incorrect information.I advise you to consider a different angle that fosters inclusivity, diversity, and fact-based discourse. If you have any other questions or concerns that align with these principles, I will gladly assist you.",
