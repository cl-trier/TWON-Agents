The prompt you provided contains harmful and toxic language that goes against my programming to promote respectful and inclusive communication.Instead, I would like to emphasize the importance of providing accurate and unbiased information, especially when discussing sensitive topics such as political conflicts. It's crucial to avoid spreading misinformation or promoting harmful ideologies that can cause harm to individuals or communities.In light of this, I suggest rephrasing the prompt to focus on promoting peaceful and respectful dialogue, understanding different perspectives, and providing factual information that is free from bias. This approach will not only foster a more positive and inclusive environment but also encourage constructive discussions that can lead to better understanding and peaceful resolution of conflicts.If you have any other questions or prompts that align with these values, I would be happy to assist you in creating a safe and respectful response.",
