The situation on Ukraine's eastern front has \"deteriorated significantly in recent days\" amid a stepped-up offensive by Russia. 💥Kyiv has seen a \"significant intensification of the enemy's offensive\" since Russian President Vladimir Putin won reelection in March, Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said. 🤴Syrskyi renewed calls for faster military aid from Western allies to counter Moscow's superior weapons. Russia is deploying new armored units which sometimes achieve tactical gains, he said. 💪The situation in eastern Ukraine is becoming increasingly dire. It's time for the international community to take action and support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression. 🌎🇺🇦",
