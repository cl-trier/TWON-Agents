    "text": "War in Ukraine could have ended with talks, but Putin & Zelensky's willingness to consider concessions surprised everyone. They were ready to finish the war if Ukraine adopted neutrality & didn't join NATO, like Finland during the Cold War. Talks failed due to focusing on postwar security order instead of ending the war first. A lesson for all parties involved.\" #Ukraine #Russia #NATO #neutrality #peace talks",
