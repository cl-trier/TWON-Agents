In 2022, 74% of children received both doses of the measles vaccine, and 83% received one dose by their first birthday! ðŸŽ‰Let's keep up the good work! Support organizations like the Measles & Rubella Partnership (M&RP) and their efforts to achieve the Immunization Agenda 2030 targets. Together, we can make sure that no one dies from measles again! ðŸ’‰ðŸ’ª #MeaslesVaccination #ImmunizationAgenda2030 #M&RP",
