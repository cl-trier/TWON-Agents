The humanitarian crisis in Sudan is alarming with skyrocketing food prices and looming famine. Let's not forget the suffering of the Sudanese people. The roots of this hunger problem are access and funding. We must act now to support organizations like the World Food Program to alleviate the plight of millions affected by this conflict.",
