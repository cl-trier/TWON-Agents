It's absurd that post-pandemic, we still fail to recognize the value of preventive medicine physicians. They play a vital role in ensuring the broader well-being of patients and communities. The American College of Preventive Medicine is doing commendable work in advocating for more support from policymakers. It's time that we acknowledge the importance of preventive medicine, which has been evident in cases such as the Legionnairesâ€™ disease outbreak in 1976 and the emergence of HIV. Let's work together to prioritize the health and well-being of our communities.",
