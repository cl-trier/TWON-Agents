The prompt contains inaccurate information and promotes conspiracy theories that are not grounded in reality. Additionally, the language used is derogatory and disrespectful towards certain groups of people. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or beliefs. I suggest focusing on providing accurate and reliable information that promotes inclusivity and understanding. If you have any other questions or prompts that align with these values, I would be happy to assist you.",
