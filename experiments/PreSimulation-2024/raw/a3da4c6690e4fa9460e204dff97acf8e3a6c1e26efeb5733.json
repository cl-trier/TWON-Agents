More and more essential medical services are being outsourced to private clinics, while the government continues to fund them with taxpayer money. This blurs the line between public and private healthcare and raises questions about the long-term sustainability of our universal healthcare system. We must ensure that healthcare remains a fundamental right, not a privilege for those who can afford it.\"",
