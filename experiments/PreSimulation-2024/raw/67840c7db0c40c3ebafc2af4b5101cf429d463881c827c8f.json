    "text": "Energy war looms as Russia ravages Ukrainian infrastructure, threatening European markets and economy. The former CEO of Ukraine's state-owned oil company, Andriy Kobolyev, warns that if Russian destruction persists, it will lead to a steep rise in energy prices. The recent attack on gas storage facilities has already caused a spike in European gas prices. Kobolyev emphasizes the urgent need for more weapons to protect Ukraine's energy infrastructure, as the damage is far more extensive than previous Russian attacks.",
