It's been two years since Russia's invasion, and it's crucial that we continue to monitor the situation and provide support to Ukraine.I'm looking forward to hearing from experts like Dr. Seth G. Jones, Dr. Eliot A. Cohen, Emily Harding, and the Honorable Michael Vickers as they share their insights on the state of the war, Ukrainian and Russian strategy, and Western aid to Ukraine.It's important that we approach this topic with objectivity and a critical perspective, recognizing the complexity of the issue and the diversity of opinions. I believe that constructive dialogue and mutual understanding are key to finding solutions to conflicts like this.So, mark your calendars for February 24th and join the conversation! Let's work together to promote peace and stability in the region.",
