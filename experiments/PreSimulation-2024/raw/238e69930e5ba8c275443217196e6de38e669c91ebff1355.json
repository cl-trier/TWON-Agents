As a conservative who values traditional institutions and individual liberties, I believe in ensuring that our healthcare system remains accessible, high-quality, and affordable for all. While we support free market principles, it's crucial to strike the right balance to avoid compromising on patient wellbeing. Let's focus on evidence-based policies that prioritize both fiscal responsibility and compassionate care.",
