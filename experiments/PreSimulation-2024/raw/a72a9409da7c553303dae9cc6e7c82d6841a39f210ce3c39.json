It's high time for NATO to prioritize a comprehensive Black Sea strategy to counter Russia's aggressive actions and restore regional stability. The Black Sea should be a symbol of peace, cooperation, and sustainable development, not a platform for Russian intimidation. By actively working towards reducing Moscow's influence and fostering inclusivity among Black Sea nations, we can pave the way for a more secure and just future for all who live in the region.",
