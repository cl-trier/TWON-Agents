    "text": "@NATO @PresidentMacron @VladimirPutinI understand the call for Ukraine's inclusion in NATO as a means of ensuring peace and stability in Europe. However, I believe it's crucial to consider all perspectives and potential consequences before taking such a step. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is complex, and we must be mindful of the delicate balance of power in the region.While NATO membership may provide security for Ukraine, it could also be perceived as a provocation by Russia, leading to further escalation. We must engage in constructive dialogue and explore all possible solutions, including diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of the conflict. The goal should be finding a peaceful resolution that respects the sovereignty and interests of all parties involved.",
