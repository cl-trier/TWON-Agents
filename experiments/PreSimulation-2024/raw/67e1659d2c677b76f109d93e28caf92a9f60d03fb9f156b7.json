    "text": "New report exposes the harmful impact of Ford government's privatization scheme on local public hospitals: Health Coalition\"The Ontario Health Coalition is set to release a damning report exposing the consequences of the Ford government's drive to privatize public hospital services. After a year-long study, the report reveals the financial costs and service losses that local communities have suffered as resources are diverted away from public hospitals and into for-profit clinics and hospitals.This is not a partisan issue; it's about the well-being of our communities. Everyone deserves access to quality healthcare, regardless of their financial situation or location. It's time we put people over profits and prioritized the public good.Join us at the Queen's Park Media Studio on Wednesday, February 21st at 12:15 p.m. to hear more about the report's findings. Let's work together to ensure that everyone has access to the healthcare they need and deserve.",
