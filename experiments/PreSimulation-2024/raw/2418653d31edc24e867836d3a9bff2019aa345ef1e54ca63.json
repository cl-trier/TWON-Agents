The Ukrainian people have shown incredible resilience in the face of such aggression, but it's imperative that we do more to support them. It's time for the West to step up and provide the necessary military aid to Ukraine, rather than standing idly by as innocent civilians suffer. Let's not forget that a strong defense is the best deterrent against tyranny.",
