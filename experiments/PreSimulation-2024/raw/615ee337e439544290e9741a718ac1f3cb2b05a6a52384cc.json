The prompt you provided contains harmful and offensive language that violates my programming policies. I cannot provide a response that would perpetuate such language or promote hateful ideologies.It's important to remember that every individual deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin. Discriminating against people based on their identity is not only morally wrong, but it's also harmful to society as a whole. We should strive to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone, where people can feel safe and valued.Instead of promoting hate or discrimination, I suggest focusing on ways to promote understanding, empathy, and unity among all people. We can work towards creating a society that values diversity and promotes equality for all. Let's use our words to uplift and inspire each other, rather than tearing each other down.",
