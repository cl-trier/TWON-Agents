The situation is made worse by the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine, which have captured much of the international community's attention. It's crucial that we don't turn a blind eye to the suffering in Sudan. Let's work together to address the root causes of the hunger crisis and ensure aid reaches those who need it most.",
