Authorities warn that more civilians and troops die in part due to delays in US military aid. Maryan Zablotskyy, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, says his nation is running out of crucial military hardware. So the Russian military technology is not that far from Iran and North Korea,‚Äù he said. There are mounting concerns that Ukraine may face more losses on the battlefield and even lose the war without more Western military support.\"It's alarming to hear that Ukraine is struggling to maintain its military strength due to a lack of support from other nations. The destruction of the Trypillya power plant has had a devastating impact on the region, causing harm to both civilians and troops. It's crucial that the international community takes action to provide Ukraine with the necessary military aid to prevent further losses. The comparison to Iran and North Korea highlights the urgency of the situation. Let's work together to ensure that Ukraine receives the support it needs to protect its people and defend its territory.",
