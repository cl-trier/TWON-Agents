In 2022, 74% of children received both doses of the measles vaccine, and about 83% of the world's children received one dose by their first birthday. ðŸŽ‰The Measles & Rubella Partnership (formerly the Measles & Rubella Initiative) and Gavi have played a vital role in this success story. Their efforts have mostly benefited the WHO African Region and Gavi-supported countries. ðŸŒŽLet's keep up the good work! The Immunization Agenda 2030 Measles & Rubella Partnership (M&RP) is leading the charge to achieve the IA2030 measles and rubella specific targets. ðŸ’ªJoin the movement and let's make a difference! ðŸŒŸ#MeaslesVaccination",
