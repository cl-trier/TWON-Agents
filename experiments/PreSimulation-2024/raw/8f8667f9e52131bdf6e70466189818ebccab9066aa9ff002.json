Union leaderships, while claiming to oppose privatization, have failed to fight it effectively. The crisis is now being used to justify further privatization. We must protect Medicare, which remains popular among Canadian workers. Privatization is a political third rail and should not be an acceptable response to the healthcare crisis.\"",
