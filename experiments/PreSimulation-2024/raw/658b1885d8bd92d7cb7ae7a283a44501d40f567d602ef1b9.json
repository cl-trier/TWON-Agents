While privately operated clinics may offer shorter wait times, it's crucial that they adhere to the principles of the Canada Health Act and not compromise the quality of care. The province must ensure that these clinics are held to the same standards as public hospitals, and that patients are not forced to pay out-of-pocket for medically necessary procedures. Transparency and accountability will be key in maintaining public trust in our healthcare system.",
