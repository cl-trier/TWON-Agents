    "text": "@NATO must recognize the importance of strategic cyber competition in the modern era. As a conservative, I believe in the importance of maintaining strong national defense and preserving traditional values. In peacetime, NATO should focus on defensive cyber operations to protect its member states from cyber threats. However, individual allies must also take responsibility for their actions in strategic cyber competition. It's crucial for NATO to engage with the technical, policy, and civil society communities to maintain domain stability in cyberspace. Russia and China pose significant challenges in this regard, and NATO must be prepared to counter their political and technological advancements.",
