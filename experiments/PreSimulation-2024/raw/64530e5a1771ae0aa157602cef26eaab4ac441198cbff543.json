    "text": "@NATO @cybersecurity #cyberspace #strategiccompetition #natosecurityAs a passionate liberal, I believe that international cooperation and collective defense are crucial in maintaining peace and stability in the digital age. The recent NATO Cyber Coalition Exercise highlights the importance of collaboration and preparedness in the face of strategic cyber threats.However, it's time for NATO to think beyond the war in Ukraine and address the challenges posed by Russia and China in the realm of cyberspace. Individual allies must also recognize their role in shaping the future of this domain.We must work towards a future where cyberspace remains a common good, accessible and free for all. NATO's efforts to promote domain stability are crucial, but we cannot do it alone. We need to engage with the technical, policy, and civil society communities to create a united front against threats to our digital security.The future of strategic cyber competition will require innovative solutions that prioritize cooperation, transparency, and collective defense. Let's work together to protect our digital world and ensure a safer tomorrow for all.",
