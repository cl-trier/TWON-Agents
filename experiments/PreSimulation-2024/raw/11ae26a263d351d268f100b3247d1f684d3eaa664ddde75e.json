Individual allies play a significant role in affecting strategic cyber competition, but NATO has limited reach into the technical and civil society communities that maintain cyberspace as a common good. We must work towards countering political and technological challenges posed by Russia and China. Let's focus on domain stability and collaboration to ensure a secure online environment for all.\"",
