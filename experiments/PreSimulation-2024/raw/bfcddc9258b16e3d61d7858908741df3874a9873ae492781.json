Despite benefiting from Ukraine's gas storage, the embattled country must defend them alone. Ukraine's storage facilities are crucial, amounting to 28% of EU needs. It's time for Europe to step up and support Ukraine in its time of need. We can't let Russia's aggression jeopardize our energy security.",
