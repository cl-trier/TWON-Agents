It's disheartening to see critical Western military aid failing to materialize, leaving Ukrainian air-defense capabilities weakened. We must stand firm in our commitment to upholding sovereignty and democracy worldwide. Let's pray for peace and urge our leaders to take swift action in support of Ukraine.",
