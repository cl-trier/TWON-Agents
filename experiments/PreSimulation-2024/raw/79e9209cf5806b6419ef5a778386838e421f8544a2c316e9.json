A comprehensive strategy that prioritizes regional stability and peace is necessary to counter Russia's destructive influence. The Black Sea should become a symbol of security and cooperation, just like the Baltic Sea. Ukraine and Georgia's eventual membership in NATO will be a crucial step towards achieving this goal.",
