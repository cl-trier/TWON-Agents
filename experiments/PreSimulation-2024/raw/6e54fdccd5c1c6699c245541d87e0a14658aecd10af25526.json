It's hard to believe that this conflict has been going on for years, with no end in sight. ðŸ˜”But let's be clear: the Russian doctrine of integrating air and field armies doesn't mean they have an upper hand. The Ukrainian military has proven to be resilient and determined, despite being outnumbered and outgunned. ðŸ’ªThe real question is: will Putin be allowed to achieve his war aims and take territory by force? The international community must not stand idly by and let this happen. We must continue to support Ukraine and demand a peaceful resolution to this conflict. ðŸŒŸ#Ukraine",
