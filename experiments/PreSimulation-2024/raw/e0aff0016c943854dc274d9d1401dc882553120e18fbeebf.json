Ministry of Public Health, has plummeted. 💸📉 Several draft bills proposed since 2013, but still no progress. 🤔 This de-facto privatization puts the NSSF's role as main insurer for private sector workers at risk. 💥 Political parties are also pushing for private initiatives, fragmenting health coverage. 🌎 Let's work towards a sustainable social security institution to achieve universal healthcare! 💪🏽",
