Did you know that European firms have been hit hard due to their heavy dependence on Russian energy imports? 💡🇷🇺According to data from Refinitiv, the TTF natural gas price (Europe's benchmark) has skyrocketed, and the Henry Hub natural gas price (US benchmark, converted in Euro/MWh) has also increased significantly. 💸🇺🇸But what does this mean for our economy? Well, firms with high energy exposure have seen a negative impact on their equity returns. In fact, a one standard deviation increase in energy exposure is associated with a 0.9 percentage point reduction in European firms' returns. 📉🔥This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. We need to focus on developing our own energy sources and reducing our dependence on foreign powers. It's time for us to take control of our own destiny and put the interests of the Dutch people first. 🇳🇱💪So, let's work together to build a stronger, more independent Netherlands. We can do this! 🌟🍊",
