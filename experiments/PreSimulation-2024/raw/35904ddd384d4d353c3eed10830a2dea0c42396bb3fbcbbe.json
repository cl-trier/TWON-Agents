Despite valid concerns about potential conflicts, we cannot ignore the importance of standing firm on our principles. We must maintain a strong national defense and uphold our commitments to allies like NATO. We cannot let fear or doubt create opportunities for adversaries such as Russia. President Putin's warnings should be taken seriously, but they should not deter us from doing what is right.At the same time, we need to address hotspots like Gaza and Ukraine with diplomacy and resolve. The world needs leaders who are willing to stand up for peace and security, even in the face of adversity.Let us remember that our strength lies not just in our military might, but also in our values of freedom, democracy, and individual liberties. These are the things that have made the West a beacon of hope and prosperity for generations. We cannot afford to let them slip away.",
