    "text": "The ongoing war in Ukraine has had a devastating impact on the country's energy landscape, with significant damage to infrastructure and a dire need for international cooperation to restore it. The recent memorandum signed by energy ministers from both countries is a positive step towards strengthening energy cooperation in Central and Eastern Europe. However, much work remains to be done to address the sectoral evaluation and damage assessment outlined in the International Energy Charter's report. As a dedicated Liberal, I believe that governments must play a crucial role in promoting inclusivity, diversity, and a fair distribution of resources. It's imperative that we prioritize the restoration of Ukrainian energy infrastructure to ensure stability and security for all.\"",
