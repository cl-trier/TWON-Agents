Ministry of Public Health, has plummeted. 💸📉 Draft bills proposed since 2013 have gone nowhere. 🤔 This de-facto privatization endangers the NSSF's role as main insurer for private sector workers. 💼👩‍⚕️ Political parties are pushing private initiatives, fragmenting health coverage. 🏥🤝 We must maintain a strong, sustainable social security institution to achieve universal healthcare! 💪🏽🌟",
