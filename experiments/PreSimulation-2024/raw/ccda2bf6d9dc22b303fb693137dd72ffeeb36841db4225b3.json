However, I believe that a strong national defense is crucial for the safety and security of any nation. The fact that Israeli defense systems and allied forces were able to intercept and shoot down many of the missiles and drones used in the attack is a testament to the importance of investing in robust defense mechanisms. It's time for nations to put aside their differences and work together towards achieving peace and stability in the region.\"",
