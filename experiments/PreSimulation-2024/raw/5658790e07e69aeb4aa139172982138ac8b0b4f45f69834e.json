Investing in targeted approaches that prioritize populations at risk, utilizing advancements in epidemiology and molecular tools, such as biomarkers and genome sequencing, can provide a more accurate measurement of an individual's risk of developing specific medical conditions. By combining polygenic risk scores with other influencing factors, we can create a more comprehensive understanding of disease risk. Let's embrace a prevention-centered healthcare delivery that ensures a healthier future for all.\"",
