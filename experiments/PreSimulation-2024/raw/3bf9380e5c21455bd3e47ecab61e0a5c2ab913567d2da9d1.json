    "text": "NATO's role in strategic cyber competition is evolving. As we move beyond the war in Ukraine, it's crucial to consider how we can effectively counter political and technological challenges posed by Russia and China. Cyberspace stability is key, but NATO has limited reach into the technical, policy, and civil society communities that maintain it.
