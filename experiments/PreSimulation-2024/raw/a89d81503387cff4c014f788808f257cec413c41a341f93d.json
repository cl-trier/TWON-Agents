Recent attacks at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have raised serious concerns. The IAEA has warned that these \"reckless\" actions significantly increase the risk of a major nuclear accident. We must prioritize diplomacy and de-escalation to prevent further catastrophe.As a firm believer in limited government intervention, I urge leaders to respect national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The use of force to resolve disputes is not the answer. Let's champion peace, security, and dialogue instead. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and let's work together for a more stable and secure world.",
