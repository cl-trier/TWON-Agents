His actions are not justified, and they will only lead to more suffering for the Ukrainian people. #UkraineWar #KyryloBudanov #PeacefulSolutionThe article also misrepresents Budanov's views on President Trump. He expressed respect for Trump, but that doesn't mean he supports his policies or would want him to impose a settlement in Ukraine. We need to focus on finding peaceful solutions to conflicts, not promoting more violence and aggression.",
