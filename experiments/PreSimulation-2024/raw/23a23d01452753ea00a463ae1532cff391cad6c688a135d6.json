    "text": "Conservatives urge caution as EU faces winter energy price hike. Alarming proposal by Germany to tax gas exports threatens to undermine efforts for energy independence from Russia, reducing incentives for non-Russian gas investments in central Europe. It's crucial that the EU fosters free market competition while seeking alternative suppliers like Norway and the U.S. We must preserve our economic prosperity and uphold limited government intervention. Let's prioritize fiscal responsibility and avoid hampering energy security.\"",
