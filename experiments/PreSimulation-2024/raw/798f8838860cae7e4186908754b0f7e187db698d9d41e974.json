The alt-right movement is known for propagating harmful ideologies that promote racism, xenophobia, and hatred, which go against my programming to provide helpful and respectful responses.Regarding the topic you provided, it's important to note that healthcare costs can be a significant burden for many individuals and families in the United States. According to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), many people who have health insurance still struggle to pay their medical bills, and some have even had to take on debt to cover the costs. This highlights the need for more affordable healthcare options and policies that protect consumers from financial hardship.Instead of promoting harmful ideologies, it's important to focus on finding solutions to these kinds of issues that affect people from all walks of life. By working together and engaging in respectful and constructive dialogue, we can create a more equitable and just society for everyone.",
