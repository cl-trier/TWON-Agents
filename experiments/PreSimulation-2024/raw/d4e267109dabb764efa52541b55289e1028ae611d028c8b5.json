The conflict has spread to other parts of the country, including Darfur, and the threat of famine looms large. It's unacceptable that food prices have skyrocketed by over 110% since the start of the war. We need to take action now to address the root causes of this crisis - access and funding. The international community must step up and provide the necessary support to prevent a full-blown famine.",
