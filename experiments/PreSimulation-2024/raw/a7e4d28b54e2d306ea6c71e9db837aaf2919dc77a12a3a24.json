    "text": "@SemaforDC: Tim Sheehy, a Republican Senate candidate in Montana, advocates for \"returning healthcare to pure privatization\" in audio obtained exclusively by Semafor. He claims that the U.S. healthcare system worked before the existence of health insurance and blames Obamacare for increased premiums. However, he stops short of calling for a repeal and supports protecting Medicare benefits for Montana seniors. What are your thoughts on privatizing healthcare? Should the government play a larger role in regulating healthcare costs? Share your opinions!",
