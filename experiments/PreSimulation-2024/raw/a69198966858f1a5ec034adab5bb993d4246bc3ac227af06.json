Skyrocketing premiums, deductibles, and copayments leave many unable to cover necessary medical costs. 🚨Shockingly, over half of working-age Americans report difficulties affording care, while three-quarters of uninsured individuals face similar struggles. It's time to prioritize healthcare reform that ensures fairness, inclusivity, and financial accessibility for all. 🌍❤️🩺Let's not forget the staggering statistic from KFF: more than 100 million Americans carry debt due to healthcare expenses! This is unacceptable in a prosperous nation like ours. Join me in advocating for change and fighting for universal healthcare coverage! 💪🤝",
