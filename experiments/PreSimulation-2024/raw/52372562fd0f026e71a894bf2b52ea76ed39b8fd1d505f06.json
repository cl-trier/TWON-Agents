More like Governor Lamont signs legislation to further line the pockets of big pharma and the healthcare industry while forgetting about the forgotten voices of everyday Americans. This so-called \"multitrack approach\" is just a bunch of empty promises and half-measures that won't do anything to address the real issues facing our healthcare system. We need real change, not just more bureaucratic red tape and special interest handouts.",
