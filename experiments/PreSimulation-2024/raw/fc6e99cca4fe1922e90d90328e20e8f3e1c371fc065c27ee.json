But let's be real, folks, the real issue here is that Ukraine was too dependent on Russia in the first place. It's like they say, 'don't put all your eggs in one basket.' And yet, they did. Now they're paying the price.But hey, I give them credit where credit is due. They've made some positive changes, like transparent energy markets and eliminating subsidies. That's a step in the right direction. But let's not forget, there's still a long way to go. Ukraine needs to keep working towards energy independence and security. It's time for them to take matters into their own hands and stop relying on others.",
