We must stand with the Ukrainian people as they defend their democracy and sovereignty. The US and its allies should take a firm stance against Russian aggression, while also pursuing diplomatic solutions to prevent further escalation. A world where borders are respected and human rights are protected is non-negotiable. #StandWithUkraine 🌍🇺🇦",
