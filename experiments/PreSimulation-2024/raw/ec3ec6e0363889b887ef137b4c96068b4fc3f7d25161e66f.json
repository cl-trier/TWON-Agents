It's all about profit over people. How can we let this happen in our country? #PrivatizationIsTheProblem #StopPrivatizationNow #TrumpCareDisaster @SenatorBernieSanders It's time for us to take a stand and fight against privatization in healthcare. We need a system that puts patients before profits. The study shows that privatization leads to worse patient care, we must act now! #MedicareForAll #NotForProfitHealthcare  @SpeakerPelosi Privatization is not the answer to our healthcare problems. We need to invest in public healthcare systems that prioritize patient care over profits. The study confirms that privatization has led to worse health outcomes, we must take action! #PublicHealthCareNow #StopPrivatization  @AOC Privatization is a threat to our society's most vulnerable members. We cannot allow hospitals to prioritize profits over the health and well-being of their patients. The study makes it clear: privatization is not working, we need a better way.",
