The ongoing conflict in Ukraine is not just a regional issue but a global concern that requires collective action from the international community. The US has always been a champion of democracy and human rights, and it's crucial we continue to lead by example. By providing military and economic support to Ukraine, we're not only helping a vulnerable ally but also sending a strong message to authoritarian regimes like Russia that their aggression won't be tolerated. Let's put aside partisan politics and come together to support Ukraine in its time of need.",
