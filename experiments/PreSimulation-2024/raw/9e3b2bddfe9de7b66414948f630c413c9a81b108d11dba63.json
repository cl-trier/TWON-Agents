    "text": "Beware the hidden costs of privatization! A study by the ER found that private sector ER care is 21% more expensive than VHA care. VCCP providers benefit from follow-up services while avoiding insurance reviews. Meanwhile, VHA providers receive specialized training to address veteran's unique needs. Let's not forget the cautionary tale of the Obama-era panel, stacked with privatization proponents like Darin Selnick who pushed for further privatization. We risk losing our only comprehensive healthcare model.",
