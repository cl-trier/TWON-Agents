As someone who values objectivity and evidence-based reasoning, I believe it's essential to evaluate the impact of such hikes on patients, families, and the entire healthcare system. Let's work together to find sustainable solutions that prioritize access to quality care without sacrificing affordability. #healthcareaffordability #rateincreases  # ProvidenceStJosephHealthSystem",
