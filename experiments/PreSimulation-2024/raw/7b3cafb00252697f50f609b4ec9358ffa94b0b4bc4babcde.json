    "text": "As the EU warns of a potential winter energy price hike due to the ending Russia-Ukraine gas deal, Germany's unilateral tax on gas exports adds complexity to the situation. With central European energy firms' investment in non-Russian gas supplies decreasing, neighboring countries are pushing for discussions at the EU energy ministers' meeting in Brussels. The bloc has already asked member states to phase out Russian fossil fuel imports by 2027 and reduced reliance by two-thirds compared to 2021. Uncertainty remains high as the pipeline situation unfolds. Let's hope for a constructive dialogue and timely resolution to ensure energy security and affordability for all EU citizens.",
