President Macron's recognition of this fact is a step in the right direction. The invasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin highlights the danger of allowing countries to remain in the grey zone between NATO and Russia. It's time for NATO allies in Vilnius to take action and extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the alliance. This isn't a matter of charity, it's a matter of self-preservation for all NATO members.",
