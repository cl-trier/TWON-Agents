    "text": "Volatility in energy prices is not just a matter of supply and demand, but also geopolitical tensions. The recent attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure by Russia are a stark reminder of how conflicts can disrupt global energy markets. Andriy Kobolyev's warning that such attacks could lead to a rise in global energy prices is not unfounded. We have already seen the impact of production cuts announced by Saudi Arabia and Russia last year, which led to higher energy prices. The situation in the Middle East remains uncertain, and any escalation could further destabilize global energy markets. It's time for nations to come together and find a peaceful solution to these conflicts, not just for the sake of energy prices but for the benefit of all.\"",
