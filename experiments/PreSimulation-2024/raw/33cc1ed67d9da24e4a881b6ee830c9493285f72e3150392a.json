    "text": "@ASG Jenƒça's warning about the Ukraine war's threat to regional stability and international security is alarming but not surprising. The ongoing conflict has already resulted in numerous human rights violations, with at least 126 civilians killed and 478 injured just in March alone. It's crucial that we continue monitoring and reporting on these violations to ensure accountability.The escalation of the war is a direct result of the lack of diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict peacefully. It's imperative that international leaders work towards finding a solution that respects Ukraine's sovereignty while addressing Russia's concerns. The alternative is a continued cycle of violence and instability that will only lead to more suffering for innocent civilians.The attack on energy infrastructure is particularly concerning, as it puts civilians at risk of fatalities and leaves many without access to basic necessities. It's unacceptable that such attacks continue to occur with impunity. The international community must take action to protect civilians and hold those responsible for human rights violations accountable.I urge all parties involved to work towards a peaceful resolution and prioritize the safety and well-being of civilians.",
