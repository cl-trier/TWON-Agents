Recent studies show that private sector ER care is 21% more expensive than VHA care, generating more revenue without normal utilization review. We should value the extensive training VHA providers receive to treat veteran-specific mental and physical problems. Let's protect our only model of comprehensive healthcare for those who have served our country.",
