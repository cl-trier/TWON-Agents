Prioritizing illness prevention over treatment is not only a more effective approach to healthcare, but it also aligns with the principles of limited government intervention and individual responsibility that I champion.Investing in employee health and wellness programs not only benefits employees' quality of life, but it also demonstrates fiscal responsibility by reducing long-term healthcare costs for both employers and employees. Kudos to VivaWell for leading this initiative and proving its ROI! #healthcare #employee benefits",
