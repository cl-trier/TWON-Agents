    "text": "China's balancing act between Russia and Europe is getting increasingly difficult. The ongoing war in Ukraine and European military buildup pose a challenge to Chinese military ambitions. Secondary sanctions and increased inspections at ports and airports are likely. China may try to bind a weakened Moscow closer while cautiously exploring off-ramps to the war. But extending the conflict indefinitely would be fruitless for China, draining resources and damaging its relationship with Russia.\"",
