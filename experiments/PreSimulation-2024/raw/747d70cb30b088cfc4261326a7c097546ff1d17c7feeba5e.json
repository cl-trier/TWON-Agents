As a Conservative, I believe in championing individual liberties and preserving traditional institutions. I'm curious, how do you plan to ensure that your work in health informatics doesn't infringe on patients' privacy and autonomy? Also, can you share some examples of how free-market principles can be applied to healthcare technology development while maintaining its accessibility and affordability for all?",
