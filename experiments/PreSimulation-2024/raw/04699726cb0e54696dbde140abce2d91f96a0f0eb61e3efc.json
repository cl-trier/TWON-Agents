Austin Scott (R-Ga.) raises a valid point - if Russia targets Ukraine's energy sector, shouldn't Ukraine have the right to defend itself? The US must support Ukraine's self-defense & address air defense resource disparities between Kyiv & the West. Let's champion peace, justice, and fairness for all!\" 💡🌍⚖️",
