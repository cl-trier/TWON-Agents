    "text": "The Russia-Ukraine war has once again highlighted the importance of international cooperation in maintaining peace and security. As a passionate liberal, I believe that it is crucial for nations to come together to support those in need, particularly when it comes to defending against aggressive authoritarian regimes. The proposal by Nato's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, to provide a 5-year, 100bn euro package of military aid to Ukraine is a step in the right direction. However, it is imperative that the international community does not rely solely on the US for military aid. All NATO member states must take responsibility and work together to ensure a fair distribution of resources for Ukraine's defense. It is time for us to stand up for our values of democracy, freedom, and human rights, and to show that we will not be intimidated by authoritarianism.",
