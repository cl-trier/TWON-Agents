The CDC has released preliminary in-season burden estimates for 2023-2024, which are updated weekly as new data becomes available. These estimates are compared to end-of-season hospitalization estimates from previous years. It's important to note that the preliminary estimates may change week-to-week and are considered final two years after the preliminary estimate. Stay safe and take preventive measures to avoid the flu!",
