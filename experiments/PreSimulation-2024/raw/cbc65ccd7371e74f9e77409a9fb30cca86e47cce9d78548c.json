    "text": "The affordability crisis in US healthcare is a stark reminder of the system's failures. PayZen's report highlights the harsh reality that many Americans can only afford a meager $97 monthly for out-of-pocket medical expenses. It's unacceptable that 36% of people have skipped necessary care due to costs, and 75% worry about affording unexpected bills. We need a fundamental transformation of our healthcare system to prioritize the wellbeing of citizens over the profiteering of insurance companies.",
