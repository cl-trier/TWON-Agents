The prompt contains language that is discriminatory and promotes conspiracy theories, which goes against my programming to provide helpful and informative responses that are respectful and appropriate.It is important to note that the Alt-Right movement is associated with white supremacist ideologies and has been linked to violence and hate crimes. Promoting or glorifying such beliefs can cause harm to individuals and communities and goes against the principles of equality and human rights. Additionally, conspiracy theories about global stability and national security are unfounded and can cause unnecessary fear and panic.Instead, I suggest focusing on promoting inclusive and respectful dialogue that fosters understanding and empathy for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin. It is important to rely on credible sources of information and to verify claims before accepting them as true.If you have any other questions or prompts that align with my programming and policies, I would be happy to help.",
