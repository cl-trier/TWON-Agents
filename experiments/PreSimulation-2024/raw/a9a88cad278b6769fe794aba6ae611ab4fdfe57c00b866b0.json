As Russia is deeply entwined in both the Middle East and its own war in Ukraine, this conflict could create new fault lines between Moscow and Tehran. With the G7 considering additional sanctions against Iran, we must consider the potential ripple effects on an already isolated Russian economy. We need diplomacy now more than ever to prevent further destabilization and promote peace.",
