It's clear that Ukraine is desperately crying out for help as they run out of missiles to defend themselves. The so-called \"mainstream media\" continues to ignore this ongoing crisis, but we won't stay silent. We stand with Ukraine and her people in their fight for freedom. #StandWithUkraine #StopRussianAggression ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦",
