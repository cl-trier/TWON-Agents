The Wagner mercenary group's claim that they've seized the last urban areas is a blatant lie. #BakhmutIsUkraine #RussiaOutOfUkraine. Meanwhile, Russia accuses the G7 of undermining global stability? That's rich coming from a country that's been fueling conflict and destabilizing the world order for years. #G7 #RussiaAccuses Also, I hope anyone who woke up at 5 am with sharp pain and strange symptoms is doing okay! ðŸ˜¬ðŸ’•",
