It's unacceptable that the union leaderships have blocked any genuine struggle against privatization by healthcare workers. The result? Telus, a massive telecommunications monopoly, has entered the lucrative healthcare game. Meanwhile, Medicare remains popular among Canadian workers, but privatization is treated as a political taboo. It's time for real change and to put an end to the cycle of defunding and privatization in our healthcare system.\"",
