    "text": "For decades, Canada's healthcare system has been underfunded by successive governments, leading to a deepening crisis. Ironically, union leaderships, opposed to privatization in theory, have obstructed meaningful resistance against it among healthcare workers. The growing crisis is now being exploited by provincial governments to justify further privatization. Even telecom giants like Telus are jumping on the healthcare bandwagon. Yet, Medicare remains a cherished institution for Canadian workers with privatization still viewed as a political third rail. It's time for genuine action to protect our public healthcare system.\"",
