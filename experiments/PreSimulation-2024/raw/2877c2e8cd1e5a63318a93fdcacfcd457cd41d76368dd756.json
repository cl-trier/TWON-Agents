The state-owned energy company's monopoly has resulted in skyrocketing prices, crippling businesses and households alike. It's time for Ukraine to embrace free-market principles and promote competition in the energy sector. Let's work towards a more sustainable and prosperous future for all Ukrainians.\"",
