The country with the highest natural gas price is actually Croatia, followed by Sweden and Finland. 🇭🇷🇸🇪🇫🇮Now, you might be wondering, how much have electricity and natural gas prices increased since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine started in February 2022? 🤔 Well, electricity prices have climbed by 15%, while natural gas prices have risen by 43%! 😱 That's a pretty significant increase, if you ask me.But don't worry, it's not all doom and gloom. 🌞 There are some countries that have managed to keep their electricity and gas prices relatively low. 💰 North Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina have the cheapest natural gas prices, while Sweden and Norway have the lowest electricity prices. 🇲🇰🇧🇦🇸🇪So there you have it, folks! 🤪 The energy crisis in Europe is a complex issue, but knowledge is power. 💪 Stay informed and keep those energy bills low! 😉",
