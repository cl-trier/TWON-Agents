The recent memorandum signed by energy ministers from Ukraine and other countries is a positive step towards strengthening energy cooperation in the region. However, much work remains to be done to assess and address the damage caused by the conflict. Let's continue to support efforts towards a sustainable and equitable energy future for all.\"",
