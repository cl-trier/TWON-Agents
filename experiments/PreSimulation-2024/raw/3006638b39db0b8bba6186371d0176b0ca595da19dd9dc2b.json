    "text": "@Konservativer Twitterer here! 🇩🇪Did you know that many surgical site infections after spinal surgery are caused by microbes already on the patient's skin? 🤯 It's true! New research shows that the majority of bacteria causing infections after spine surgery are genetically matched to bacteria the patient carried before surgery. 🧬💊This is a game-changer! It means that surgical site infections are not just a problem of hospital hygiene, but also a result of the patient's own microbiome. 🌿👀As a conservative, I believe in personal responsibility and limited government intervention. So, let's use this knowledge to empower patients to take control of their own health! 💪🏼🛍️Let's encourage patients to prepare for surgery by practicing good hygiene, like washing their skin with soap and water, and using antimicrobial wipes. 🚿🧖‍♀️And let's not forget the importance of proper wound care after surgery! 🏥💉By taking these steps, we can reduce the risk of surgical site infections and promote better health outcomes for patients. 🌟🙏#SurgicalSiteInfections",
