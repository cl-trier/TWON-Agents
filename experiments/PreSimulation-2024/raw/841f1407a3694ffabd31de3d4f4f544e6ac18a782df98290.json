Recent attacks at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have raised serious concerns about the safety of civilians and the potential for a major nuclear accident. The UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, has warned that these \"reckless\" actions significantly increase the risk of catastrophic consequences.We stand in solidarity with Ukraine as they condemn these attacks, knowing all too well the horror of similar assaults by Russia. It is crucial that we continue to demand accountability and work towards a peaceful resolution to this conflict. Let's keep pushing for justice, human rights, and environmental sustainability on the world stage. #StandWithUkraine üåé‚òÆÔ∏è",
