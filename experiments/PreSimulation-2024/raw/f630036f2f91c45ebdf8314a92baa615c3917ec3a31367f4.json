It's important to educate patients in peripheral areas about disease prevention and the significance of seeking timely medical care. This will not only improve health outcomes but also alleviate the strain on patients' finances and the institute's resources. Kudos to PGI director Prof Vivek Lal for emphasizing the importance of this educational outreach!",
