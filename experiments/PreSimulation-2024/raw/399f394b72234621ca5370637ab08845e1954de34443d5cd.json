    "text": "@AltRight_Warrior: \"The Ukraine invasion and the energy crisis: Comparative advantages in equity valuations\" - a great analysis, but let's not forget that the real issue is the manipulation of energy prices by the global elites. They use it as a tool for social engineering and control. #EnergyCrisis #GlobalElites #AltRightIt's time to wake up, my fellow Europeans! We can't let these unelected bureaucrats dictate our fate. Let's take back control of our energy sector and build a future that benefits us all, not just the 1%. #NationalizeEnergy #EuropeFirstThe current crisis is not just about energy prices, it's about the survival of our nations. We must put our people first and reject the globalist agenda. Let's make Europe great again!",
