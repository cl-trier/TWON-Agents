    "text": "The ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia is a stark reminder of the urgent need for international cooperation and diplomacy. The recent Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil refineries, while understandable given Russia's relentless aggression, only serve to deepen tensions and jeopardize efforts towards a peaceful resolution. As a dedicated Liberal, I believe it is crucial for the U.S. and other global leaders to take a firm stance against violence and work towards a comprehensive ceasefire agreement. The time for posturing and political point-scoring is over â€“ the lives and well-being of innocent civilians are at stake.",
