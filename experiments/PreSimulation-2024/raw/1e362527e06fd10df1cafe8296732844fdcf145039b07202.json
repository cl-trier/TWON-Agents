The targeting of civilian areas and essential services is unconscionable and a clear violation of international law. We stand with Ukraine and call on the global community to take immediate action to provide critical aid, including robust air defense systems. It's time for accountability and an end to these heinous acts of aggression. #StandWithUkraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦",
