    "text": "Ukraine's struggle against Russia's aggression is complex and challenging. Morale among troops is low due to constant bombardment, lack of advanced weapons, and losses on the battlefield. The situation is dire, and even President Volodymyr Zelenskyy admits that Ukraine is trying to find a way not to retreat. However, military officers privately accept that more losses are inevitable this summer. It's a tough reality, but we must continue to support Ukraine in their fight for sovereignty and territorial integrity.",
