The prospect of regional stability in Europe is crucial, and Ukraine's security is a key factor in achieving this goal. The West Germany model, which involves security assistance commitments and eventual NATO membership, could be a viable solution for Ukraine. However, it's essential to consider the unique aspects of Ukraine's situation and tailor any arrangements accordingly. A regional consultation mechanism, such as the contact group established for the Russia-Ukraine war armistice, could also be beneficial in promoting stability and cooperation among regional states. Ultimately, our goal should be to create a strong and stable Europe, where nations can thrive and collaborate peacefully.",
