The expansion of private clinics offering medical imaging and cataract surgeries is just the beginning. Now, hip and knee replacements are also being added to the list. It's great that the province is taking steps to ensure that people don't have to pay for medically necessary procedures, but let's not forget that this expansion is happening at the expense of our public hospitals. The private sector will always prioritize profits over patient care.",
