    "text": "An energy war is being waged\": former oil boss warns of price rises after Ukraine infrastructure attacks. The Russian destruction of Ukrainian energy infrastructure will have a dramatic impact on European energy prices, warns Andriy Kobolyev, former chief executive of Ukraine's state-owned oil company. If European energy markets start to believe the Russians are winning this war, it will have a dramatic negative effect on energy prices. The recent strike on Ukraine's gas storage facilities in the west of the country caused a significant spike in European gas prices because these facilities are still operational and are still used by European gas traders. The damage being inflicted on Ukraine's energy network is far more extensive than Russian attacks in the winter of 2022-23. We must take action now to support Ukraine and prevent further destruction of their energy infrastructure.",
