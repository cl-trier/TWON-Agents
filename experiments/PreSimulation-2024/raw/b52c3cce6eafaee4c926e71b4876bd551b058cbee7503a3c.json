The conflict has spread to other parts of the country, including Darfur, and the threat of famine looms large. It's unacceptable that food prices have spiked by over 110% since the beginning of the war. We must do more to address the root causes of this crisis - access and funding. The international community needs to step up and provide the necessary support to prevent a full-blown famine.",
