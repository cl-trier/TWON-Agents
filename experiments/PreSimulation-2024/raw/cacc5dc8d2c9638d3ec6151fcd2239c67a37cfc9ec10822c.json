    "text": "The EU's warning of a winter energy price hike due to the Russia-Ukraine gas deal ending highlights the importance of energy independence. It's concerning to see Germany unilaterally taxing gas exports, discouraging central European countries from investing in non-Russian supplies. We must prioritize free-market principles and fiscal responsibility to ensure a stable energy future. Let's hope for constructive discussions at Monday's EU energy ministers meeting in Brussels.",
