    "text": "Prevention is key when it comes to brain health, and we need to do a better job of measuring it.\" - Dr. Sanjay Gupta at the AHA Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. I couldn't agree more! It's crucial that we prioritize our health and take proactive steps to prevent illnesses, rather than simply reacting to them after they've already developed.And let's talk about the surge in diabetic drug use for weight loss - while it's great that people are taking steps to shed some pounds, we need to make sure we're doing it in a healthy way. We can't rely solely on drugs to solve our weight problems; a balanced lifestyle is still the best formula for success.Lastly, I appreciate Dr. Gupta's cautious approach to artificial intelligence in healthcare. \"Trust, but verify\" is a wise motto when it comes to AI - we must ensure that the technology is used responsibly and ethically, and doesn't supplant human judgment entirely.#PreventionIsKey",
