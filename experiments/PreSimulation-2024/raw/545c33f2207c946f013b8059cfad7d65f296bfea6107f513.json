    "text": "Let's talk about the escalating tensions between Ukraine and Russia. As Ukraine defends itself against Russian aggression, they've targeted oil refineries, disrupting 10% of Russia's capacity.

It's crucial we support Ukraine while also promoting diplomatic solutions to maintain global peace and stability.",
