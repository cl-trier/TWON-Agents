The Kremlin's missiles are threatening the very infrastructure that supports our energy needs. Ukraine's storage facilities are crucial to the EU's energy supply, making up 28% of our needs. We must stand with Ukraine and support their defense against Russian aggression. Our prosperity and security depend on it.",
