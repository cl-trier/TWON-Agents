The truth is, the system has been chronically underfunded for decades, and union leaderships have failed to take meaningful action. We need a real plan to address the crisis and ensure that every Canadian has access to quality, public healthcare. Privatization is not the answer - it's time for our government to prioritize people over profits.",
