The conflict has spread to other parts of the country, including Darfur, and the threat of famine looms large. Food prices have skyrocketed by over 110% since the beginning of the war, making it difficult for people to access basic necessities. The root of the problem is twofold: lack of access and funding. We must do more to address this crisis and ensure that the people of Sudan have access to the resources they need to survive.",
