It's a complex situation with both sides constantly innovating and adapting. Just like in World War I, we're seeing a mix of air and ground warfare, with Russian doctrine prioritizing the integration of air and field armies to gain superiority. But what happens if Putin is allowed to achieve all of his war aims inside Ukraine? Will it change the game entirely?
