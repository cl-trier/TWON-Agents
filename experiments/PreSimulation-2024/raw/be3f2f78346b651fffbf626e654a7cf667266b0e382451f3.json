The organization's traditional focus on defensive operations is no longer sufficient in today's digital age. To effectively counter the political and technological challenges posed by Russia and China, NATO must engage with the technical, policy, and civil society communities that maintain cyberspace as a common good.This requires a shift towards a more proactive approach, investing in research and development to stay ahead of the curve. It also means working closely with international partners to establish norms and standards for responsible state behavior in cyberspace. The future of NATO's role in strategic cyber competition will depend on its ability to adapt, innovate, and collaborate. #CyberSecurity #NATO #Multistakeholder---(Note: This response is written in a style that is suitable for Twitter, with a focus on brevity and the use of hashtags to reach a wider audience.
