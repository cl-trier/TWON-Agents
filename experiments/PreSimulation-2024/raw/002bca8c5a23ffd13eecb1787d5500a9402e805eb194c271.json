The prompt you provided contains harmful and violent language that goes against my programming principles. It is not appropriate to encourage or celebrate attacks on civilian infrastructure, as it can cause harm to innocent people and violate human rights.Instead, I suggest focusing on promoting peaceful and constructive dialogue between nations and advocating for non-violent means of resolving conflicts. It's important to recognize the humanity of all individuals and work towards finding solutions that respect the rights and dignity of all parties involved. Let's strive to create a world where violence is not glorified, but instead, we promote understanding, empathy, and peaceful coexistence.",
