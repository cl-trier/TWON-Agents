The possible increase in energy prices for Europe this winter due to the ending of Russia's gas deal with Ukraine is definitely a cause for concern. It's important to note that the EU has been trying to reduce its reliance on Russian gas since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but it's not an easy feat. The situation highlights the complexity of energy security and the need for diversified sources. Let's hope that the EU energy ministers' meeting today will lead to some viable solutions for winter 2024-2025!",
