    "text": "@ASG Jenƒça's warning about the Ukraine war being a threat to regional stability and international security is alarming but not surprising. The recent surge in attacks on energy infrastructure resulting in casualties, including fatalities, highlights the severity of the situation. It's crucial for OHCHR to continue monitoring and reporting on human rights violations to ensure accountability. The fact that they have a daily presence near frontline areas allows them to document firsthand accounts, which is essential in addressing this crisis. Regional stability and international security are at risk, and it's imperative for the global community to take action towards a peaceful resolution.",
