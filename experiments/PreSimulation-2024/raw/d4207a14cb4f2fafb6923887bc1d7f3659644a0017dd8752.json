The damage being inflicted on Ukraine's energy network is far more extensive than Russian attacks in the winter of 2022-23. 💥 It's time for us to step up and show some solidarity with Ukraine. 🤝Let's make our voices heard and demand that our leaders take action! 🗣️ We can't just sit back and let this happen. The future of our planet depends on it. 🌎💚",
