No more political correctness â€“ let's defend our sovereignty, our values, and our way of life. The Black Sea should be a sea of peace, stability, and prosperity, not a hotbed for Russian aggression. Let's stand with Ukraine and Georgia as they seek to join NATO and restore security in the region.",
