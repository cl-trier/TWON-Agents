Ministry of Public Health, has plummeted. Draft bills proposed since 2013 have gone nowhere. 🤦‍♂️ This de-facto privatization puts the NSSF's role as main insurer of private sector workers at risk. 💼 Political parties are also pushing for private initiatives, leaving the future of universal healthcare uncertain. 🤔 We must protect & strengthen our social security institutions to ensure everyone has access to quality healthcare! 💪",
