Germany must continue to provide military aid to Ukraine, so they can protect themselves against Russia's aggression. The upcoming URC24 conference in Berlin is a great opportunity for the international community to come together and support Ukraine's reconstruction. Let's make sure that the \"Nothilfe Ukraine\" memo is used effectively to provide relief to those in need.",
