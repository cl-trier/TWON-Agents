Researchers from Oxford University analyzed 13 longitudinal studies across high-income countries, examining quality of care before and after service privatization. Findings highlight concerns on staffing levels, patient mix, services provided, doctors' workload, and patients' health outcomes like avoidable hospitalizations. As we value evidence-based policy, these results deserve careful consideration to ensure the best possible healthcare for all.",
