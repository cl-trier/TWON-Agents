We must shift our focus from reactive medicine to proactive care, harnessing the power of genome sequencing and polygenic risk scores to predict and prevent disease. It's time to prioritize the health of our populations, rather than simply treating illness. Let's embrace this revolution in healthcare and reclaim control over our well-being.",
