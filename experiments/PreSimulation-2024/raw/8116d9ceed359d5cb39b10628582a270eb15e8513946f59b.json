As a proud conservative, I believe in the importance of standing with allies who share our values and principles. Russia's aggression against Ukraine is a direct threat to the stability of Europe and the world order. It's crucial that we continue to provide military support to Ukraine, so they can defend themselves against Putin's regime. The sanctions imposed on Russia must be enforced, and Germany hosting the URC24 conference is a step in the right direction. Let's work together to ensure that aid reaches those who need it most.",
