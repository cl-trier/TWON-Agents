    "text": "The Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian oil refineries have understandably heightened tensions between the US and Russia. However, it's crucial to recognize that Ukraine is merely defending itself against Russia's persistent attacks. The international community must not turn a blind eye to Russia's aggression and must support Ukraine's right to self-defense. It's time for the US to reevaluate its stance on the refinery attacks and prioritize the protection of innocent lives in Ukraine.",
