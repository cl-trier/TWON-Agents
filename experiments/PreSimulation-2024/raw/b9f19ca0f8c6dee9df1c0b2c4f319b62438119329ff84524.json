Russian forces have seized control of the village of Pervomaiske in the Donetsk region, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. The news comes as a Russia-installed official in the Zaporizhzhia region reported that shelling by Ukraine's military resulted in the deaths of 10 people, including three children, in the town of Tokmak. My heart goes out to the families and loved ones of those affected by this senseless violence.The conflict in eastern Ukraine has been ongoing for far too long, and it's time for all parties involved to work towards a peaceful resolution. The international community must continue to put pressure on Russia to end its aggression and support a ceasefire. The innocent civilians caught in the crossfire deserve our attention and action.",
