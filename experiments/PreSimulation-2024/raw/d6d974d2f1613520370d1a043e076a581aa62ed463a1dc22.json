    "text": "🇺🇦💡 Did you know that the energy crisis caused by the Ukraine invasion has had a negative impact on European firms' equity returns? 💰📉 According to a study by Ferriani and Gazzani, a one standard deviation increase in energy exposure is associated with a 0.9 percentage point reduction in European firms' returns. 📊💻 This is due to Europe's heavy dependence on energy imports from Russia. 🇷🇺🔌 The study used data from Refinitiv and found that the impact of energy exposure on equity returns was particularly acute in Europe. 🇪🇺💸 So, it's important to consider the energy factor when evaluating equity investments in Europe. 💡👍",
