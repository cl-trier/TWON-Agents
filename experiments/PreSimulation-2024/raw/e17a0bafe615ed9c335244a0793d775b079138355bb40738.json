Es zeigt sich yet again that dog owners and vets have different perspectives on what constitutes a \"healthy\" senior dog. A checklist of common missed clinical signs before a vet visit could be helpful in identifying potential health issues earlier. It's great to see initiatives like the BSAVA PetSavers Ageing Canine Toolkit (ACT) being implemented to improve senior dog healthcare. Let's keep the conversation going and work together to ensure our furry friends receive the best care possible as they age 🐾💕",
