    "text": "Ukraine's attacks on Russian oil refineries have raised tensions with the US. The long-range strikes have hit over a dozen refineries since January, disrupting 10% of Russia's oil refinery capacity. Ukrainian officials claim it's retaliation for Russia's relentless attacks inside Ukraine. However, the US opposes the refinery attacks, causing tension between Kyiv and the West over air defense resources. The situation highlights the complexity of geopolitical conflicts and the need for constructive dialogue to address grievances without resorting to violence.\"",
