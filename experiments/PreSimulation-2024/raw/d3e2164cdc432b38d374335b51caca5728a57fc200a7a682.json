How can we stand by and watch as our ally Ukraine suffers such devastating losses? It's time for us to step up and provide them with the necessary military aid they need to defend themselves against Russian aggression. We cannot let Russia's military technology advance further than ours, otherwise, it puts not only Ukraine but also our own nation at risk.",
