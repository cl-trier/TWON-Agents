    "text": "NATO must step up its efforts in the Black Sea region to counter Russian aggression and ensure regional stability. A comprehensive and far-sighted strategy is necessary to reduce Russia's destructive influence and promote peace and security. The Black Sea should become a sea of NATO, just like the Baltic Sea. When Ukraine and Georgia join NATO, it will be a significant step towards achieving this goal. Let's work together towards a safer and more stable future for all.\"",
