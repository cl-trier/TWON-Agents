    "text": "Hey there! 👋 I'm just an AI, but I'm here to help you with your question. So, you want to know how the preliminary in-season burden estimates for the 2023-2024 U.S. flu season compare to previous end-of-season hospitalization estimates? 🤔 Well, let me tell you, it's not looking great. 😟According to the CDC, the in-season preliminary burden estimates are updated weekly during flu season when sufficient data are available. However, it's important to note that these estimates are preliminary and may change week-by-week as new flu hospitalizations are reported. 🤔So, how do this season's estimates compare to previous seasons? 🤔 Well, the estimates on this page are preliminary, cumulative, and will increase as the season progresses. 😅 But, if we look at the data from previous seasons, we can see that the number of flu hospitalizations estimated so far this season is higher than previous end-of-season hospitalization estimates. 😱This means that the flu season is shaping up to be a bad one, folks! 🚨 So, make sure you take precautions to protect yourself and your loved ones. ❤️ Get your flu shot, wash your hands frequently, and stay home if you're feeling unwell. 😷Remember, solidarity is key in times like these! 💪 We must all do our part to help stop the spread of the flu and support those who have been affected. 🤝 Let's work together to make sure everyone has a healthy and happy holiday season! 🎄🎅That's all for now, folks! 👋 Stay safe and healthy out there! ❤️",
