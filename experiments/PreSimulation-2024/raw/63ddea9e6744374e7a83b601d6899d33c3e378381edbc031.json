Germany's Chancellor Scholz is right in urging China's President Xi to use his influence over Russia to bring about a peaceful resolution. The redeployment of Wagner troops from Africa to Ukraine is a concerning development that should be closely monitored. Let's work together towards a diplomatic solution and avoid further bloodshed.",
