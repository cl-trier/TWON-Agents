As Russia becomes more entangled in Ukraine, this new conflict between its ally Iran and Israel could create even more fault lines for Moscow. With the G7 considering additional sanctions on Iran, the ripple effects may impact Russia's already fragile economy. Let's hope that cooler heads prevail, and a path towards peace and diplomacy is pursued.",
