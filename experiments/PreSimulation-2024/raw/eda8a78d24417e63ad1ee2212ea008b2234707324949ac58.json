With over 20% of their power generation knocked out and potential damage to European pipelines, it's clear that no one wins in this lose-lose situation. We urge diplomacy, not further escalation, to protect human rights, ensure energy security, and work towards a sustainable future for all. #StandWithUkraine 🌍🕊️",
