A recent study shows that 27% of non-senior adults face severe healthcare affordability issues, such as high out-of-pocket costs, medical debt, or forgone care. This number jumps to 46% when we include delayed care. It's unacceptable that so many people are forced to choose between their financial stability and their health. We need policies that prioritize the well-being of our citizens over the profits of insurance companies.",
