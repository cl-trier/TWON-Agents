As a passionate liberal, I believe it's the state's responsibility to ensure affordable and sustainable energy for all citizens. The current price hikes are hurting households and businesses alike, and it's our duty to hold our leaders accountable for their inaction. Let's work together to find progressive solutions that prioritize people over profits.",
