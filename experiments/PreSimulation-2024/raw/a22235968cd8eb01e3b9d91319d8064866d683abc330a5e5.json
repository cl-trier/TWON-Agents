VHA providers undergo extensive training to better understand and treat veteran-specific mental and physical problems. 💪🏼🧠Let's not forget the Obama-era panel, stacked with privatization fans like Darin Selnick, who dissented from the final report because it didn't go far enough in his favored direction. 🤔💭The real question is: do we really want to lose our only model of comprehensive health care? 🤷‍♀️👀#PrivatizationWarning",
