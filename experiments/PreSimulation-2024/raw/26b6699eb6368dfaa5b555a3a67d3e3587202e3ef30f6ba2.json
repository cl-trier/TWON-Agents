The West Germany Model, security assistance commitments, and a potential NATO membership could pave the way for a ceasefire and lasting peace. Additionally, establishing a Regional Consultation Mechanism through the contact group created for the war armistice could foster collaboration and address long-standing disagreements in the region.
