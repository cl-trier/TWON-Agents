Ukraine's membership in NATO is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of all parties involved. Let's not forget that Ukraine has its own interests and agency, and we should respect their sovereignty. We need to engage in constructive dialogue and find a solution that works for everyone, not just impose a solution from the outside.",
