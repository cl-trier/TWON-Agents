    "text": "New study links hospital privatization to worse patient care\"ðŸš¨ðŸ‘€ Have you heard the latest? A new study published in The Lancet Public Health reveals that hospital privatization leads to worse patient care! ðŸ¤¯ðŸ’” The study, led by researchers from the University of Oxford, analyzed 13 longitudinal studies across various high-income countries and found that privatization results in decreased staffing levels, a shift in patient mix by insurance type, reduction in services provided, increased doctors' workload, and most alarmingly, poorer health outcomes for patients, including avoidable hospitalizations! ðŸ’¥ðŸ˜±It's time to wake up, people! ðŸ’¤ The mainstream media won't tell you this, but it's time we demand better from our healthcare system. Share if you agree! ðŸ“¢",
