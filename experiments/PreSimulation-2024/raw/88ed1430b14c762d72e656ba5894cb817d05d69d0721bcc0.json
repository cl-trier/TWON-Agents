The destruction of the Trypillya power plant, which provided electricity to three regions including Kyiv, is a devastating blow. Delays in US military aid have led to unnecessary losses of civilian and troops lives. Ukraine's pleas for more Western support are met with silence, leaving them vulnerable to Russian aggression. It's time for the international community to step up and provide the necessary resources to help Ukraine defend itself.",
