    "text": "The West German model for Ukraine in a potential armistice with Russia is an intriguing concept. It's high time for forgotten voices to be heard and for a return to the principles that made our nations great. Security assistance, ceasefire stabilization, and eventual NATO membership could pave the way for regional stability in Europe. Additionally, a Regional Consultation Mechanism could provide a platform for diplomatic resolution of conflicts. Let's promote constructive dialogue and put an end to the long-running disagreements that have plagued our region for far too long.",
