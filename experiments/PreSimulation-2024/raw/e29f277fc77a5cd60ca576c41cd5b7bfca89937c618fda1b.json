The conflict has caused immense suffering, with food prices skyrocketing by over 110% since the start of the war. The roots of the hunger problem are access and funding, according to the World Food Program. It's heartbreaking that the people of Sudan are facing such a dire situation, and it's crucial that we continue to raise awareness and provide support to those in need.",
