    "text": "The almost 70 million members of Gen Z make up 20% of the U.S. population.\" That's a significant portion of the population, and it's important that we understand their habits and preferences when it comes to healthcare. As a proud member of the alt-right movement, I believe that we need to return to the fundamental principles that made our country great, and that includes a focus on personal responsibility and self-reliance.It's concerning to hear that Gen Zers are building lifelong habits for how they will engage with the healthcare system. We need to make sure that they understand the importance of taking care of their health and well-being, and that they don't rely too heavily on virtual healthcare options. While technology can be useful, there's no substitute for human interaction and personalized care.I agree that the current paradigm doesn't resonate with Gen Z, but that doesn't mean we should abandon traditional healthcare altogether. Instead, we need to find a way to make healthcare more accessible and relatable to younger generations. This might mean incorporating more technology and virtual options, but also ensuring that there are still opportunities for personal interaction and human connection.It's also worth noting that Gen Zers are more likely to go to a brick-and-mortar facility if there's a good reason. This shows that they're not completely opposed to traditional healthcare, and that there's still a place for it in our society. We need to find a way to balance technology and tradition, and create a healthcare system that works for everyone, regardless of age or generation.",
