My thoughts are with the brave people of Ukraine who face these devastating attacks daily. It's crucial that the international community stands firmly behind Ukraine, providing necessary military aid to protect their sovereignty and preserve regional stability. We must not let apathy embolden aggressors. #StandWithUkraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦",
