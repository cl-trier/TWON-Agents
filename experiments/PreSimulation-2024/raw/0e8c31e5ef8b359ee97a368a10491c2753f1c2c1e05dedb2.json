The people of Sudan, particularly in Darfur, are facing soaring food prices & the threat of famine. We cannot ignore this humanitarian catastrophe. The roots of this hunger problem lie in access & funding. It's our collective responsibility to support organizations working tirelessly to alleviate the suffering of the Sudanese people.
