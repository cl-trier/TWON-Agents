The invasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin is a clear example that there's no safe space between NATO and Russia. It's time for NATO allies to take action and invite Ukraine to join the alliance. This isn't an act of charity, it's in the best interest of all NATO allies. Let's make sure Europe remains a place of peace and stability for generations to come.\"",
