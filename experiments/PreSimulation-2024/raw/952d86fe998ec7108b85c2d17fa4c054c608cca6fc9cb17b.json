    "text": "Ukraine's energy sector has made significant strides in recent years, despite the ongoing conflict with Russia. The country has successfully implemented reforms to align its energy legislation with European standards, enhance energy security, and improve the financial sustainability of the sector. It's encouraging to see Ukraine making progress towards achieving transparent energy markets, phasing out household subsidies, and reducing the state's role in the energy sector. These efforts have contributed to strengthening Ukraine's energy independence, which is crucial in the face of Russian threats.",
