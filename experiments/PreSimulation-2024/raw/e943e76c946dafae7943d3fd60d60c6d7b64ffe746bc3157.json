    "text": "@SurgicalSiteInfection #SpinalSurgery #MicrobesOnSkin #HospitalAcquiredInfectionsDid you know that many surgical site infections after spinal surgery are caused by microbes already on your skin? 🤯 New research shows that the majority of bacteria causing infections after spine surgery are genetically matched to bacteria present before surgery. 🧬💉 This means that surgical site infections are more likely due to bacteria already on your skin than from microbes in the hospital! 🚫🏥It's time to think differently about surgical site infections and how we can prevent them. Let's work together to reduce the risk of infection and promote a healthier surgical environment for all patients. 💪🏼👍What are your thoughts on this new research? Share your opinions and let's start a conversation! 💬👇",
