Denmark - â‚¬30.5 per 100 kWh2. Germany - â‚¬28.6 per 100 kWh3. Belgium - â‚¬27.9 per 100 kWhAs for natural gas prices, the top three countries with the highest prices are:1. Netherlands - â‚¬14.5 per 100 kWh2. Germany - â‚¬13.8 per 100 kWh3. Belgium - â‚¬13.4 per 100 kWhSince Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine started in February 2022, electricity prices have increased by 36% and natural gas prices have climbed by 46%. ðŸ˜±But don't worry, folks! The EU is working hard to diversify its energy sources and reduce dependence on Russian imports. ðŸ’ªðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ºSo, there you have it! Energy prices might be high, but with a little bit of unity and determination, we can overcome any obstacle. ðŸ’–",
