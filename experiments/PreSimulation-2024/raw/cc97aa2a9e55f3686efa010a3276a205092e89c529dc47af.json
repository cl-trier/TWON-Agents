However, this doesn't mean expanding government intervention at the expense of individual liberties or burdening taxpayers with excessive costs. Instead, let's promote competition, transparency, and innovation in the free market to drive down prices and improve quality of care. After all, a healthy population is vital for a thriving nation.",
