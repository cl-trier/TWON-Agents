Say it ain't so! 😱 A new report shows that privatizing healthcare in Ontario won't reduce wait times, but may actually increase them. 🤦‍♀️ Instead, we'll see higher costs, less staff in the public system, and more upselling, self-referrals, and unnecessary procedures. 💸👀 It's time to stop relying on market forces and start prioritizing the health and well-being of our communities! 🌟 Let's keep fighting for a publicly-funded, equitable healthcare system that puts people over profits! 💪",
