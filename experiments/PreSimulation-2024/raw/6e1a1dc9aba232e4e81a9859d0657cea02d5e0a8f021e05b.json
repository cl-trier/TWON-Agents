The potential disintegration of Western hegemony threatens to upend global stability.Despite Italy and Spain's well-founded anxieties, we cannot shy away from addressing the risks posed by wavering NATO commitments. A strong defense is not merely an option, but a necessity in these uncertain times.Meanwhile, Russian opportunism looms large as tensions rise in Gaza and Ukraine. We must remain vigilant, lest we find ourselves sleepwalking into a conflict of global proportions.In these challenging times, let us remember the importance of fiscal responsibility and free-market principles. They have served as the bedrock of our economic prosperity and will continue to do so in the face of adversity. We must stand firm in our convictions, championing individual liberties and preserving time-honored institutions. Only then can we hope to weather this storm and emerge stronger on the other side.",
