It's refreshing to see companies like VivaWell taking a proactive approach to employee health by prioritizing illness prevention in their benefit plans. By investing in the well-being of their workforce, businesses can not only improve productivity but also reduce healthcare costs in the long run. This is a prime example of how the private sector can drive positive change without relying on government intervention.",
