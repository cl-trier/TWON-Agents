    "text": "@UkraineEnergySector #Ukraine #EnergySector #RussiaIt's been 10 years since the war started, and it's high time to assess the impact on Ukraine's energy sector. While Russia's threats haven't disappeared, Ukraine has made significant strides in strengthening its energy security & achieving transparency in the sector. ðŸ’¡We've come a long way since 2014, adopting European-aligned laws & eliminating subsidies for households. The state's role in the energy sector has been diminished, paving the way for private investment and competition. ðŸ’°Despite Russian aggression, Ukraine has shown resilience in its pursuit of energy independence. We must continue to support these efforts & ensure that our energy sector remains robust and secure. ðŸ’ª",
