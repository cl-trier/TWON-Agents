    "text": "Unfortunately, the healthcare system in Canada has been in crisis for decades due to consecutive governments' underfunding. It is a complicated matter since government leaders claim to oppose the privatization of healthcare while union leaders block any genuine fight against it by healthcare workers. The increasing crisis has allowed all provincial administrations to justify more privatization, which has also involved large corporations like Telus in the profitable healthcare industry in recent years. Despite this, Medicare remains well-liked among Canadian employees, and privatization is still viewed as politically untouchable.\"",
