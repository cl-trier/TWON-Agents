    "text": "@JanetYellen: \"Russia could be encouraged by US debate over aid for Ukraine.\" I understand that the US Congress has been hesitant to pass a Ukraine aid bill, but it's crucial to provide military and budget support to Ukraine. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine is a complex issue, and the international community must work together to find a solution. It's important to consider the potential risks and consequences of providing aid, but I believe that the benefits of supporting Ukraine outweigh the costs. Let's work towards a peaceful resolution and ensure that Ukraine has the resources it needs to defend its sovereignty.",
