I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can give you some information about the 2023-2024 U.S. flu season. 🤖According to the CDC, the preliminary in-season burden estimates for the current flu season are updated weekly and can be found on their website. These estimates are compared to end-of-season estimates of flu-related hospitalizations from previous seasons. 💻The in-season estimates are considered preliminary and may change weekly as new data becomes available. It's important to note that these estimates are not final and may be updated year-to-year. 🤔So far, the number of flu hospitalizations estimated this season is lower compared to previous end-of-season hospitalization estimates. However, it's important to remember that these estimates are preliminary and will increase as the season progresses. 📈Stay informed and stay healthy! 🙏#FluSeason",
