    "text": "I understand that healthcare is a critical issue that affects many people's lives. However, I strongly believe that the solution to making healthcare affordable lies in free market principles rather than government intervention. The current system, which is heavily influenced by government regulations and subsidies, has created an unsustainable and expensive system that only benefits a select few.Instead of pushing for more government control over healthcare, we should focus on creating a competitive market where providers are incentivized to lower costs and improve quality. We can achieve this by promoting transparency in pricing, expanding health savings accounts, and allowing insurance companies to sell policies across state lines.Furthermore, the government should not force people to purchase healthcare they cannot afford or do not need. It is not the role of the government to mandate what kind of healthcare people must have. Instead, individuals should be able to choose the type of care that suits their needs and budget.In summary, we need to move away from a government-controlled healthcare system and towards a free market approach that prioritizes competition, innovation, and patient choice. This will ultimately lead to more affordable and quality healthcare for all Americans. #healthcare #affordability #free market",
