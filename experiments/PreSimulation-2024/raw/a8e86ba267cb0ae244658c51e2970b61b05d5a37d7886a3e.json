Ministry of Public Health, has plummeted. 💸📉 Draft bills proposed since 2013 have gone nowhere. 🤔 This de-facto privatization puts the NSSF's role as main insurer of private sector workers at risk. 💳 Political parties are also pushing for private initiatives, leaving the future of universal healthcare uncertain. 🤝 We must protect & strengthen our social security institutions to achieve true universal health coverage! 💪",
