    "text": "The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine is not only a threat to regional stability, but also to global energy security. The latest attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure is a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of war. As a Conservative, I believe in the importance of national defense and the preservation of traditional values. It's time for the international community to take action and provide Ukraine with the necessary weapons to protect its energy infrastructure. We cannot afford to let Russia's aggression go unchecked, or the consequences will be felt far beyond Ukraine's borders.",
