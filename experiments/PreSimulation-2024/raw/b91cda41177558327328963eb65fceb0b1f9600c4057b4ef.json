    "text": "NATO must expand its focus beyond the Ukrainian conflict to address the complexities of strategic cyber competition. While NATO's defensive efforts are crucial, it's individual allies who shape cyberspace in peacetime. The challenge lies in the fact that NATO has limited influence over the global multi-stakeholder community that maintains cyberspace. Moreover, powers like Russia and China pose significant political and technological threats to our strategic position. It's time for NATO to strengthen its engagement with technical, policy, and civil society communities to ensure a stable and secure cyberspace for all.\"",
