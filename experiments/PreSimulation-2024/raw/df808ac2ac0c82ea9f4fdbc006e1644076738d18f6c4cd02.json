The CDC's preliminary in-season burden estimates are updated weekly, but they're always compared to end-of-season estimates from previous years. Why? Because they want us to believe that this season is worse than usual. But what they're not telling us is that the number of flu hospitalizations estimated so far this season is actually lower than previous seasons. Don't fall for their scare tactics.",
