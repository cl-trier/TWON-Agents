    "text": "EU energy ministers will meet in Brussels on Monday to discuss Germany's unilateral tax on gas exports, which is complicating efforts to reduce reliance on Russian imports. The tax is reducing incentives for energy firms in central Europe to invest in non-Russian gas supplies. The EU has already asked its countries to phase out imports of Russian fossil fuels by 2027 and has made progress by slashing its reliance on Russian gas by around two-thirds compared to 2021. However, the recent move by Berlin is creating uncertainty in the pipeline and making it more challenging for the bloc to achieve its energy goals. It's time for constructive dialogue and cooperation among EU nations to address this challenge and ensure a stable energy supply for the coming winter.",
