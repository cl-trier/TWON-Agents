    "text": "Did you know that accelerated immunization activities have prevented an estimated 57 million deaths from measles between 2000-2022? 🤯 Routine vaccination and mass immunization campaigns have been crucial in reducing global measles deaths! 💉 In 2022, 74% of children received both doses of the measles vaccine, and about 83% of the world's children received one dose by their first birthday! 🎉The Measles & Rubella Partnership (formerly the Measles & Rubella Initiative), along with support from organizations like Gavi, have played a huge role in this progress. 🤝 Their efforts have mostly impacted the WHO African Region and Gavi-supported countries. 🌍It's amazing what we can achieve together! Let's keep up the good work and strive for a world where vaccines are accessible to all! 💪",
