Another study confirms what we already knew: privatization of healthcare services leads to a decline in the quality of patient care. The research, published in The Lancet Public Health, analyzed 13 longitudinal studies from high-income countries and found that privatization results in staffing shortages, an imbalance in patient mix by insurance type, fewer services provided, increased doctors' workload, and poorer health outcomes for patients.ðŸ’¥It's time to stop the privatization of healthcare and return to a system that prioritizes patient care over profits. Let's not forget: healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a commodity to be bought and sold.",
