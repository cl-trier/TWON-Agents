This is a clear example of the nanny state mentality that seeks to coddle individuals and strip them of personal responsibility. It is not the role of employers or government to ensure the health and wellness of citizens; it is up to individuals to take care of themselves.Furthermore, prevention-centered healthcare plans are a perfect example of political correctness gone wild. Instead of focusing on real issues like border control and national security, we are wasting resources on feel-good initiatives that cater to the entitled and lazy. It is time for us to return to the fundamental principles that made our country great, not pander to special interests and create more dependence on government programs.I urge all Latin American corporations to reject this misguided approach to healthcare and focus on creating jobs and driving economic growth. The last thing we need is more government intervention in our lives.",
