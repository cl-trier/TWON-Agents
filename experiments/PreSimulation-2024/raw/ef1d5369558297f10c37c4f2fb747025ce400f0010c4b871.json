    "text": "🚨 Energy War Alert! 🚨Russia's relentless destruction of Ukrainian energy infrastructure will have a devastating impact on European energy prices if left unchecked. The former CEO of Ukraine's state-owned oil company, Andriy Kobolyev, warns that the damage is far worse than previous attacks and could lead to a dramatic rise in prices. 💸💥The recent strike on Ukraine's gas storage facilities in the west has already caused a significant spike in European gas prices. 🔥 These facilities are still operational and used by European gas traders, making them a critical target for Russia's attacks. 🏛️Kobolyev emphasizes that the survival of Ukraine's energy network is crucial to reconstructing the country's economy. 💪 But without more weapons to defend its infrastructure, Ukraine risks being left with nothing. 😱The stakes are high, and time is running out. The international community must take action now to support Ukraine and prevent a disastrous energy crisis. 🌎💡",
