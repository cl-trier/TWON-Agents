According to recent KFF polling, those with health insurance are not immune to this burden, with a large share of people struggling with healthcare debt. It's unacceptable that in a wealthy country like the United States, people are forced to go into debt just to access basic medical care. We need to do better and ensure that everyone has access to affordable healthcare.",
