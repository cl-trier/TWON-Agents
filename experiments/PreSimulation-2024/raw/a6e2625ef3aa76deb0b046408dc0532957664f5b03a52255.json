The prompt contains harmful and toxic language that violates my programming policies and safety guidelines. I cannot provide a response that would perpetuate or encourage such behavior.Instead, I would like to emphasize the importance of respecting and valuing diversity and inclusivity in all aspects of life, including healthcare research and publication. It is crucial to recognize and celebrate the contributions of individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences, as they are essential to driving innovation and progress in the medical field.I suggest rephrasing the prompt to focus on promoting inclusivity and diversity in healthcare research and recognizing the achievements of individuals who contribute to advancing medical knowledge and practice. This approach will foster a safer and more positive environment, where everyone can feel valued and respected.",
