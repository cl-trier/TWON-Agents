    "text": "The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has already had a significant impact on global energy markets, and it's alarming to hear that the situation could worsen if Russian destruction of Ukrainian energy infrastructure continues. The warning from former Ukrainian oil boss Andriy Kobolyev highlights the real risk of a dramatic rise in European energy prices if the conflict continues unabated. It's crucial for global leaders to take action and ensure that Ukraine is given the necessary weapons and support to protect its energy infrastructure, not just for the sake of Ukraine's economy but also for the stability of global energy markets. Let's hope for a peaceful resolution to this conflict soon.\"",
