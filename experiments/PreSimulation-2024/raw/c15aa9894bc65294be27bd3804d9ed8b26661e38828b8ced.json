    "text": "Energy exposure has had a negative impact on European firms' equity returns, with a one standard deviation increase in energy exposure associated with a 0.9 percentage point reduction in returns. This is according to data from Refinitiv and a recent working paper by Ferriani and Gazzani (2023b). The findings suggest that firms with high energy exposure have been disproportionately affected by the ongoing energy crisis, likely due to their heavy dependence on energy imports from Russia.",
