This raises concerns about the push for privatization of veteran healthcare services.Each follow-up service provided by private-sector providers generates more revenue, while avoiding standard insurance company utilization review. However, VHA providers undergo extensive training to better understand and treat veteran-specific mental and physical problems.It's worth noting that the Obama-era panel, which included privatization proponents like Darin Selnick, dissented from the final report, claiming it didn't go far enough in promoting privatization. If we lose the VHA, we'll also lose the nation's only model of comprehensive healthcare.Let's be cautious and consider the long-term consequences of privatizing our veterans' healthcare. Evidence suggests that privatization may not always result in better care or cost savings.",
