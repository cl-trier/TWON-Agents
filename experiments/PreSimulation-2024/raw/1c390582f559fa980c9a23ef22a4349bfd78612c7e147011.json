The prompt you provided contains language that is discriminatory and harmful, and it is not appropriate for me to engage with such content.It's important to remember that spreading hate or discrimination towards any individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or any other characteristic is not acceptable and goes against the principles of respect and dignity for all people. Everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and compassion, regardless of their background or beliefs.Instead, I suggest focusing on promoting inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all individuals. We can work towards creating a society that values and celebrates different perspectives and beliefs, and where everyone is treated with dignity and respect. Let's strive to create a world that is welcoming and inclusive for everyone.",
