Supporting Ukraine is not just a matter of humanitarian aid, it's a crucial investment in international security. ğŸ’ªThe Iraq War cost $3 trillion and countless lives, yet it failed to improve US national security. In contrast, supporting Ukraine helps stabilize the region and prevents further conflict. It's a smart and responsible use of resources. ğŸ’¡Don't let petty politics jeopardize global stability. Put aside differences and stand united in support for Ukraine. ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ğŸ’•",
