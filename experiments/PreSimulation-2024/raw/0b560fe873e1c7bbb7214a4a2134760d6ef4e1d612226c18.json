    "text": "The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has serious implications for the global energy market. The destruction of Ukrainian energy infrastructure by Russia could lead to a significant increase in European energy prices, according to Andriy Kobolyev, former CEO of Ukraine's state-owned oil company. The recent attack on Ukraine's gas storage facilities is just one example of how the war is affecting energy supplies. It's crucial that we prioritize peaceful solutions and work towards preserving critical infrastructure to avoid further price hikes and economic instability.",
