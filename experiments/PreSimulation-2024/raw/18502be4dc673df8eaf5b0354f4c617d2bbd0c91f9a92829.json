The Ukrainian authorities are doing a great job with daily financial administration and advancing the country's reform agenda. 🚀 They're even exceeding expectations! 😲 Who knew? 🤔So, let's give it up for Ukraine! 👏 They're showing us all that even in tough times, determination and hard work can pay off. 💪🏼",
