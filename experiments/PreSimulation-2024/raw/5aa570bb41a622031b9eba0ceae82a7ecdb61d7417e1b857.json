While it may claim that privatized hospitals deliver lower quality care, it fails to mention the financial burden lifted off taxpayers when services are run by the private sector. It's time we start focusing on the bigger picture - giving people a choice in their healthcare and promoting competition to drive down costs and improve efficiency.",
