    "text": "Reflecting on Ukraine's energy sector after a decade of war, it's impressive to see the strides made towards transparency, financial sustainability, and alignment with European rules despite significant challenges. The shift from dependency on Russian energy has not been easy, but Ukraine has shown resilience. Achievements like abandoning household subsidies and minimizing the state's role in the sector are commendable. However, let's not forget the continuous threats Russia poses to Ukraine's energy security. The journey continues, and constructive dialogue remains key to further progress.",
