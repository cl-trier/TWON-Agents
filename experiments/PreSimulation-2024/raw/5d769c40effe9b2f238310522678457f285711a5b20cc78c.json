The Ukrainian President Zelensky said that Bakhmut is not occupied by Russia, while the Wagner mercenary group claimed that Russia had seized the last urban areas. It's crucial to stay informed and critical in our assessment of the information presented, especially when it comes to geopolitical tensions. Let's keep an eye on the situation and avoid spreading misinformation or jumping to conclusions.\"",
