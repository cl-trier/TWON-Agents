    "text": "The escalating crisis in Ukraine is deeply concerning. Reports of 126 civilians killed and 478 injured in March alone are unacceptable. The recent attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, resulting in casualties and fatalities, further underscore the urgency of this situation. It's crucial that we document these human rights violations to pave the way for accountability. As a firm believer in national sovereignty and international security, I urge all parties to respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine and work towards a peaceful resolution. We must stand together against unprovoked aggression to maintain regional stability and global peace. #StandWithUkraine 💔🙏🇺🇦",
