However, I also recognize the significance of medical research and education in improving public health and advancing clinical practice. It's crucial to support and encourage young researchers and clinicians in their pursuit of knowledge and innovation, especially in fields such as patient safety, global surgery, clinical microbiology, and infectious diseases. Let's work together to promote the development of new methods and technologies that will benefit society as a whole.",
