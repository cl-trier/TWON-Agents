We need to address the root causes of our health problems, and that starts with our lifestyles and habits. 🤷‍♂️ We can't just rely on doctors and hospitals to fix everything. We need to take responsibility for our own health and well-being. 💪And that's where preventive health care comes in. By educating ourselves and others on healthy habits and early detection, we can prevent diseases from happening in the first place. 🚫 It's a no-brainer, folks! 🤷‍♂️So, kudos to PGIMER for taking the lead on this initiative. Let's hope more organizations and individuals follow suit. 💪🏼 Together, we can make a difference and create a healthier society for all! 🌟",
