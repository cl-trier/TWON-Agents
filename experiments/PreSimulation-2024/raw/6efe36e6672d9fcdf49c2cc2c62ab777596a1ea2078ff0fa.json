It's time for us to stand up and support those in need! 💪🏽🚨 Military support for Ukraine 💥 Ukraine must be able to defend itself against Russia's brutal attacks. We must do everything in our power to help them! 💪🏽💰 An unprecedented sanctions regime 💸 For as long as Russia continues to attack Ukraine, there must be consequences. We cannot stand idly by and watch as innocent lives are lost! 😡📢 Together with Ukraine, Germany will host the international reconstruction conference URC24 in Berlin from 11 to 12 June 2024. Let's work together towards a better future for all! 🌟💼 By adding the memo \"Nothilfe Ukraine\" (emergency aid for Ukraine) to bank transfers, we can provide relief measures for those affected by the conflict. Every little bit helps! 💰Let's stand together and show our support for Ukraine! 🇺🇦💕",
