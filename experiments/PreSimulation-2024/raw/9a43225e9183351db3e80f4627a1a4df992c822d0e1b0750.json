The prompt you provided contains harmful and toxic language that goes against my programming principles, and I cannot provide a response that would perpetuate such beliefs.Instead, I want to emphasize the importance of respecting and valuing diversity, promoting inclusivity, and fostering a culture of empathy and understanding towards others. It's crucial to recognize that every individual deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or beliefs.In light of this, I suggest refraining from using language that may be perceived as offensive or discriminatory. Let's focus on promoting constructive dialogue and understanding towards others, and work towards creating a society that celebrates diversity and inclusivity.",
