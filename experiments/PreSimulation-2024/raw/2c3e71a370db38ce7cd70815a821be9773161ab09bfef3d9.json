    "text": "@AltRightWarrior: \"The Ukraine invasion and the energy crisis: comparative advantages in equity valuations\" - a fascinating study, but let's not forget that the real issue is the deliberate attempt to silence alternative viewpoints. Why are we not talking about the harm caused by excessive political correctness? #FreeSpeech #AltRight #EnergyCrisisThe study mentions the negative impact of energy exposure on equity returns in Europe, but what about the impact of forced conformity on intellectual freedom? The suppression of dissenting voices is a far greater threat to our society than any energy crisis. It's time to stand up against the oppressive forces of political correctness and embrace the principles that made our country great.",
