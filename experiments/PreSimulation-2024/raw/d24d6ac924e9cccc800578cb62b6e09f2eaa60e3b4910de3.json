    "text": "The ongoing war in Ukraine has had a profound impact on the country's energy landscape, with significant damage to infrastructure and an assessment of the sector's functioning. A recent report by the International Energy Charter highlights the consequences of the war on Ukrainian energy, including a memorandum signed by energy ministers from both countries to strengthen energy cooperation in Central and Eastern Europe. The report evaluates the Ukrainian energy sector and assesses damage as of May 24, 2023. It's crucial to understand how this impacts not only Ukraine but also international relations and energy security.",
