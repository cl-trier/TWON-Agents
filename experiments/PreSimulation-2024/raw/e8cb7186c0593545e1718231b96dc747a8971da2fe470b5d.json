His diplomatic prowess tamed relations with China & Russia, dividing the Communist bloc. Today, we're grappling with strategic overreach in the Middle East & a dangerous rivalry with both powers. It's time to return to the wisdom of statesmen like Kissinger, remembering that effectiveness doesn't excuse immorality, but shouldn't be forgotten either.",
