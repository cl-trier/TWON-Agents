    "text": "@UkraineEnergySector #EnergyReforms #UkraineRussiaRelationsAfter a decade of conflict, Ukraine's energy sector has undergone significant changes. Despite Russia's continued threats, Ukraine has made great strides in strengthening its energy security and achieving greater financial sustainability. The country has adopted crucial laws to align its energy legislation with European standards, creating a more transparent and competitive market. Subsidies for households have been eliminated, and the state's role in the energy sector has been reduced. These positive changes are a testament to Ukraine's resilience and determination to create a more sustainable future.",
