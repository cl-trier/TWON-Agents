    "text": "Ukraine's energy sector has undergone remarkable changes over the past decade despite facing numerous challenges due to the ongoing war. The country has made significant strides towards achieving fully transparent energy markets, doing away with household subsidies, and eliminating the state's role in the energy sector. Ukraine's efforts to align its energy legislation with European standards have been crucial in strengthening energy security and ensuring financial sustainability. Despite Russia's relentless threats, Ukraine has made noteworthy progress in improving energy security. Let's acknowledge and celebrate these achievements!",
