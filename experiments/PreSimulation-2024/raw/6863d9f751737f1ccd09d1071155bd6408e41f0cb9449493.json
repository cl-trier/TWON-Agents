    "text": "🚨 Women's Health 2.0: The AI Era 🚨👩‍💻 Predictive tech is key to closing the health gender gap, but we must address the challenges and biases in data collection and analysis. #WomensHealth #AIforGood #GenderEquality💬 Reproductive health is just the beginning. We need a more comprehensive approach to women's health that includes mental, physical, and social well-being. #BroadenTheDefinition👀 Did you know that women have been historically excluded from health research and clinical trials? It's time to shine a light on the blind spots in women's healthcare. #InclusionMatters💪 Let's work together to create a future where AI-driven healthcare solutions are designed with and for women, addressing their unique needs and experiences. #WomenLeadingTheWay #HealthEquity🚨 The White House Initiative on Women's Health Research is a step in the right direction, but we need to keep pushing for more funding and support. Let's make women's health a national priority! 💪",
