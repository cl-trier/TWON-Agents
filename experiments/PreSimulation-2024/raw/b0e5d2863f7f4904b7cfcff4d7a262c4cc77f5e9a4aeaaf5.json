    "text": "Congratulations to the nine physicians at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences who were named Healthcare Research All-Stars! It's no surprise that UAMS is leading the way in hip and knee surgery, orthopaedic surgery, gastrointestinal surgery, and general surgery. Their commitment to research and innovation is a testament to their dedication to providing the best possible care for their patients. As a conservative, I believe in the importance of limited government intervention and the power of free-market principles. This achievement by UAMS is a great example of how individual excellence and merit can drive success in healthcare, without the need for excessive government involvement. Keep up the great work, UAMS!",
