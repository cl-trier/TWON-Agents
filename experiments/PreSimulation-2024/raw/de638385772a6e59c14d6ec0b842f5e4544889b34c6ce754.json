Apollo Hospitals' ProHealth program, an AI-driven personalized preventive health check, sets a great example of how technology can be leveraged to promote preventive healthcare practices. It's encouraging to see the growth in awareness among women, but we still have a long way to go in ensuring that everyone has access to such life-saving measures. Kudos to Apollo Hospitals for their efforts in promoting preventive healthcare and contributing to a healthier India!\"",
