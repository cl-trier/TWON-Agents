The conflict has spread to other parts of the country, including Darfur, and the risk of famine looms large. Food prices have skyrocketed by over 110%! It's a heart-wrenching reality that people are struggling to access basic necessities like food. We need to act now and support organizations working on the ground to address this crisis.",
