    "text": "@PayZen's latest report reveals a startling reality: 36% of Americans have skipped necessary medical care due to unaffordable out-of-pocket expenses. The findings are a clear indication of the healthcare affordability crisis in the US, where individuals can only manage a monthly payment of $97 on average. It's alarming that 75% of respondents worry about unexpected medical bills, and those without insurance often delay or forgo care for over a year due to costs. This report highlights the need for affordable healthcare solutions. Let's work together towards ensuring everyone can access quality healthcare without breaking the bank.",
