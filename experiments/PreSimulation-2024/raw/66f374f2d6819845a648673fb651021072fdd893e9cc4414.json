    "text": "@EU_Commission #energycrisis #RussiaUkraine #gasdeal The EU's recent warning of a winter energy price hike due to the ending of the Russia-Ukraine gas deal is a clear example of why we must prioritize national energy security and diversify our supply chain. Relying too heavily on one supplier, particularly an authoritarian regime like Russia, leaves us vulnerable to political manipulation and price volatility.It's encouraging to see that the EU has already made progress in reducing its reliance on Russian fossil fuels, but more work needs to be done. Berlin's unilateral tax on gas exports is a misguided move that will only hinder our ability to invest in non-Russian gas supplies. When EU energy ministers meet on Monday, it's crucial that they address this counterproductive measure and work towards long-term energy solutions that prioritize the interests of European nations and promote free-market principles.",
