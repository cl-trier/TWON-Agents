The Russian military claims they've taken Bohdanivka, but Ukraine's Defense Ministry denies this and says fighting is ongoing.Syrskyi admits that Russian forces have been actively attacking Ukrainian positions in three areas of Donetsk region, near Lyman, Bakhmut, and Pokrovsk. Ukraine is struggling with a shortage of ammunition, making it harder to defend against Russia's superior firepower and personnel.ðŸ’¥ It's clear that the conflict in eastern Ukraine is far from over. The situation on the ground is intense, and both sides are determined to gain the upper hand. ðŸ’¥ðŸŒŸ Let's keep a close eye on developments in the region and continue to support efforts towards a peaceful resolution. ðŸŒŸ#Ukraine",
